		// The code that loads this file automatically does a few things here:
		//
		// 1. For each "Game" search path, it adds a "GameBin" path, in <dir>\bin
		// 2. For each "Game" search path, it adds another "Game" path in front of it with _<langage> at the end.
		//    For example: c:\hl2\cstrike on a french machine would get a c:\hl2\cstrike_french path added to it.
		// 3. For the first "Game" search path, it adds a search path called "MOD".
		// 4. For the first "Game" search path, it adds a search path called "DEFAULT_WRITE_PATH".
		//

		//
		// Search paths are relative to the base directory, which is where hl2.exe is found.
		//
		// |gameinfo_path| points at the directory where gameinfo.txt is.
		// We always want to mount that directory relative to gameinfo.txt, so
		// people can mount stuff in c:\mymod, and the main game resources are in
		// someplace like c:\program files\valve\steam\steamapps\half-life 2.
		//
		SearchPaths
		{
			// First, mount all user customizations.  This will search for VPKs and subfolders
			// and mount them in alphabetical order.  The easiest way to distribute a mod is to
			// pack up the custom content into a VPK.  To "install" a mod, just drop it in this
			// folder.
			//
			// Note that this folder is scanned only when the game is booted.
			//game+mod			ep2/custom/*
			//game+mod			episodic/custom/*
			//game+mod			hl2/custom/*

			// Now search loose files.  We'll set the directory containing the gameinfo.txt file
			// as the first "mod" search path (after any user customizations).  This is also the one
			// that's used when writing to the "mod" path.
			game+mod			|gameinfo_path|addons/*
			game+mod			|gameinfo_path|custom/*
			//mount Workshop stuff
			game+mod			"|gameinfo_path|..\..\..\workshop\content\397680\*"
			//Mount the DLC.
			game+mod			|all_source_engine_paths|firefightreloaded_dlc/cstrike/*
			game+mod			|all_source_engine_paths|firefightreloaded_dlc/dod/*
			//We need this to load any shared files the DLCs need.
			game+mod			|all_source_engine_paths|firefightreloaded_dlc/dlc_shared/*
			game+mod+mod_write+default_write_path		|gameinfo_path|.
			
			//Call the VPK
			game				|gameinfo_path|firefightreloaded_pak.vpk

			// We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in
			// VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files
			// in folders where they don't exist.  (Searching a VPK is much faster than making an operating
			// system call.)
			// this VPK was made so we can load the contents of hl2mp without any config overrides.
			game+mod			|all_source_engine_paths|sourcebase/hl2mp_shared.vpk
			//game+mod			|all_source_engine_paths|sourcebase/episodic_shared/ep2.vpk
			//game+mod			|all_source_engine_paths|sourcebase/episodic_shared/episodic.vpk
			//this VPK was made so we could lower the file space. previously we used the files above and they added 
			//3-4 WHOLE gigabytes to the game, making it a WHOPPING 9 GIGABYTES! This method decreases the file size 
			//by half, while still providing the episodic NPCs.
